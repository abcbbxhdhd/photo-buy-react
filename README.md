<h1>I PROMISE TO DEVELOP MY FRONTEND SKILLS BY THE NEXT PROJECT</h1>

--------------------------------
<h2>By the way, I grow fast at React and here what I have practiced while doing this project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hooks!!! (useState, useEffect, useContext)</li>
  <li>React Router features like different hooks (useLocation, useParams, useHistory) and basic routing (BrowserRouter, Link, Route, Routes</li>
  <li>My favorite React Context that made my life so easier (Provider, Consumer)</li>
  <li>React children (really difficult theme, but im tryna learn it)</li>
</ul>

-------------------------------

Also I learnt more about reusability and react performance like PureComponent(that i won t use cause i dont like class components), React.memo() (I hope that I will use it). Also, props rendering, but frankly I forgot what is that about and what for it exists.

-------------------------------
<h1>IM GONNA CONQUER REACT SOON!!!</h1>
